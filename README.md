# Agile-Plan-With-ZenHub

## Project Description

User stories are written by developers to capture a user's specific needs. They can be used to indicate who a user is, what they need to do, and why they need to do it. A user story should be concise, yet descriptive enough to give the development team a good understanding of the user's needs.

The issue template that is contained in this repository can be used to help create user stories that are well-formed and easy to understand on ZenHub. This template can be used as is, or it can be modified to suit the needs of your specific project. Either way, using this template will help ensure that your user stories are clear, concise, and easy to work with.

## Project Scenario

The stakeholders require the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete products from the catalog. They have also asked for customers to be able to "like" a product and have the site show the like count on the product page.
